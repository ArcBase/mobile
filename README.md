# Skyhitz Mobile App

Skyhitz is a music app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skyhitz/id1105406020) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skyhitz.skyhitz) designed to serve creators around the world so they can share their music for free and receive [XLM Stellar Lumens](stellar.org) in exchange for their work.

* The app is being built with [Expo](https://expo.io) using `Typescript`, `React` and `Mobx React`. 
* It consumes a [common module](https://github.com/skyhitz/common) that manages all the state of the app and makes requests to a [GraphQL Api](https://github.com/skyhitz/api).
* Works on iOS and Android
* For a good developer experience we recomend using `VSCode` so you can better navigate the entire code easily.

## Open source
